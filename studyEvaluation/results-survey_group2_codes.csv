Es kann als Motivation dienen sich weiter mit dem Paper auseinanderzusetzen. Sicherlich kann es auch für Personen ansprechend sein, die sich regelmäßig mit Papern auseinandersetzen und auch ihnen neue Blickwinkel eröffnen.","In der Augmented Reality Version gehen Informationen verloren.

Chrome-Browser on a different phone ended up working.

It was a little hard for me to understand what to do in this study initially. sorry about that.","2875.41","193.92","139.81","82.92","425.73","165.49","167.54","170.62","156.63","318.77","1053.98"
